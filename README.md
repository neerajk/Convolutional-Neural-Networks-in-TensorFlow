# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-in-TensorFlow
 the 1st assignment of the course! This week, you will be using the famous Cats vs Dogs dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. For this, you will create your own Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities.
